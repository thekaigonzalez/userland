UserLand - a kux distribution where YOU are the creator.

what is kux?

    kux is a multi-platform specification for subsystems. it was designed a few
    years ago to be a no-stick easy to use system to understand user
    interaction, as well as provide virtual environment mockups for testing
    purposes.

    userland conforms to the kux specification, and acts as a normal
    distribution as usual. the only thing that the user themself needs to do is
    program it.

    in real terms, although not an actual operating system, this kux
    distribution could be considered a ring 0 system, as well as allows the user
    to take control of the system and extend it in any way they see fit.
    

so how does userland work?

    userland is a kux distribution that is fully compiled, which does not mean
    you can pick it right up and use it, that means that to get functionality on
    your userland distribution you need to program it.

    the core userland is very small, because it is meant to be extended by user
    scripts.

    when you run ./userland, you generate a file that contains the userland kernel
    code. this file is then compiled and can be executed.

notes

    in the different reserved directories, there are different filenames for
    different types of files. Here is a list of them:
